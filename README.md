### Hi there, ðŸ‘‹ I'm Iuri, full-stack engineer

I've been working on startups since 2006. I have experience implementing protocols, building cutting-edge applications, and maintaining multiple microservices.

Most of my time I'm building using the JavaScript ecosystem (React, Node.js, React Native, ...) but I also have experience with several programming languages.
